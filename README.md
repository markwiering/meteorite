# Meteorite *Complete*

---> This is a fork by me (Mark Wiering) of the original repository of Bauxite. The only change I made to this repository is: I included the font file uni0553-webfont.ttf, whereas the original GitHub repository doesn't include this file and instead links to a website that is down for several years. For convenience, you can fork this repository instead. I haven't changed a thing except for including uni0553-webfont.ttf! Enjoy this marvellous game, made by Bauxite! :-D 

Below is the original text by Bauxite of the initial GitHub repository. I only removed the text containing the dead link. ;-)

Your combative skills and self-defense will be tested by numerous turrets and a giant floating eyeball boss that shoots purple laser beams.
